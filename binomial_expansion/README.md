The purpose of this kata is to write a program that can do some algebra. Write a function expand that takes in an expresion with a single, one character variable, and expands it. The expresion is in the form `(ax+b)^n` where `a` and `b` are integers which may be positive or negative, `x` is any one character long variable, and `n` is a natural number. If `a = 1`, no coeficient will be placed in front of the variable. If `a = -1`, a "-" will be placed in front of the variable.

The expanded form should be returned as a string in the form `ax^b+cx^d+ex^f...` where `a`, `c`, and `e` are the coefficients of the term, `x` is the original one character variable that was passed in the original expression and `b`, `d`, and `f`, are the powers that `x` is being raised to in each term and are in decreasing order. If the coeficient of a term is zero, the term should not be included. If the coeficient of a term is one, the coeficient should not be included. If the coeficient of a term is `-1`, only the `-` should be included. If the power of the term is `0`, only the coeficient should be included. If the power of the term is `1`, the caret and power should be excluded.
